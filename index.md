**Rebeca** (Reactive Objects Language) is an actor-based language with a formal foundation,
designed in an effort to bridge the gap between formal verification approaches and real applications.
It can be considered as a reference model for concurrent computation,
based on an operational interpretation of the actor model.
It is also a platform for developing object-based concurrent systems in practice.
