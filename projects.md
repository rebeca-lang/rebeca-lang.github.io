      <p class="light">
        CRYSTAL mainly focuses on assessing the security aspects of Cyber-Physical Systems. In this project, we use Timed Rebeca and model checker Afra to specify and verify the behavior of CPS components against CPS-related attacks. We analyze architecture of CPS design to recognize where the potential attacks can successfully lead the system to security violation.

      <p class="light">
         In distributed control systems, multiple primary controllers in redundancy plans can lead to inconsistency. In this project we model and formally verify the NRP FD algorithm. We identify an issue and propose a solution to enhance the robustness and reliability of such systems. <a href="{{ "/allprojects/DistributedControllers" | relative_url }}">Learn more</a>
