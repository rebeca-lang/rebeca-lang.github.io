      <p class="light">
        CRYSTAL mainly focuses on assessing the security aspects of Cyber-Physical Systems. In this project, we use Timed Rebeca and model checker Afra to specify and verify the behavior of CPS components against CPS-related attacks. We analyze architecture of CPS design to recognize where the potential attacks can successfully lead the system to security violation.

          wRebeca is an actor-based modeling language, an extension of Rebeca, proposed for modeling and verification of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). It is supported by the tool, which efficiently generates the state spaces of models. Several techniques have been exploited to reduce the state spaces like counting abstraction (which is sound in case the underlying topology is static), and removal of un-observable transitions (which preserves the ACTL-X properties of the original model).

          Understanding the impacts of a mobility initiative prior to deployment is a complex task for both urban planners and transport companies. To support this task, Tangramob offers an Agent-Based (AB) simulation framework for assessing the evolution of urban traffic after the introduction of new mobility services. This allows urban planners and transport companies to evaluate the efficacy of their initiatives with respect to the current urban system. In this project, we simplified the Tangramob model into a Timed Rebeca (TRebeca) model and we designed ToolTRain, i.e. a tool-chain.

          PTRebeca language is developed for supporting the modeling and verification of real-time systems with probabilistic behaviors. The syntax of PTRebeca is a combination of pRebeca and TRebeca. We propose the appropriate semantics for PTRebeca to be able to model and verify probabilistic properties. In a probabilistic assignment, a value is assigned to the variable with the specified probability. Notably, by using probabilistic assignment, the value of the timing constructs (delay, after, and deadline) can also become probabilistic.
