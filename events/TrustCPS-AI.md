##### **Title: Certainty or Intelligence: Pick One!**

##### **Abstract**  
Cyber-physical systems are systems that integrate software and networking with physical components that sense and actuate in the physical world. Traditionally, to make them trustworthy, engineers strive to make their behaviors predictable, repeatable, and provably safe. While security is essential to achieving these objectives, it is by no means sufficient. Many technical challenges arise with sporadic connectivity, real-time behaviors, and handling of inevitable faults.  

While the integration of machine-learning-based AI systems holds promise of being able to help deal with many of the security and other challenges, they simultaneously make behaviors less predictable and repeatable. In this talk, I postulate that the certainty that is traditionally achieved with rigorous engineering methods may be fundamentally incompatible with integrating intelligence into our systems. The question then becomes, how do we get the advantages of intelligence with acceptable risk?

##### **Title: Learning and Monitoring the Operational Design Domain for AI-Based Autonomy**  

##### **Abstract**  
The deployment of autonomous systems in complex environments has increased significantly in recent years, with many relying on machine learning (ML) components for critical decision-making tasks. However, ML models are inherently brittle and prone to failures that can compromise system safety. This highlights the need for a systematic methodology to identify the conditions under which autonomy pipeline components may fail at design time and to detect such failures at runtime.  

This talk introduces a novel safety assurance approach for autonomous systems based on runtime verification. Runtime verification involves extracting information from a system at runtime and evaluating it to determine whether an execution satisfies or violates a given (safety) property. We will present recent advancements in runtime verification methods for capturing operational design domains (ODD), the conditions under which a system or its components are designed to operate safely. We will introduce a formalization for monitorable ODDs and discuss challenges in learning monitors for ODDs in noisy and unpredictable environments.

##### **Title: Guardians of the AI-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems**

##### **Abstract**  
As AI systems become integral to cyber-physical systems, ensuring their dependable behavior has never been more critical. Although developed by scientists and engineers, AI components may behave differently from traditional engineered artifacts. After facing challenges in explaining AI behavior, we are shifting our focus toward shielding AI components using guardrails to ensure system dependability. In this talk, we present a range of projects we have worked on aimed at safeguarding AI-enabled cyber-physical systems from AI misbehavior. Our efforts include techniques such as digital twins, property-based testing, mutation testing, and runtime monitoring. The presentation is based on the work of Zahra Moezkarimi, Masoud Ebrahimi, Khashayar Etemadi Someoliayi, Kristina Lundqvist, Kaj Hänninen, Per Strandberg, and Paul Pettersson.

##### **Title: The EU AI Act in Light of CPS: Assessing the Challenges and Impact of the Act’s Requirements on Industry**

##### **Abstract**  
The EU AI Act represents a significant legal framework with extraterritorial reach. This presentation will start with an overview of the AI Act and how it relates to CPS, followed by an in-depth analysis of its high-risk requirements from a software engineering perspective. Drawing on our recent study findings, we will identify the most challenging requirements as perceived by industry practitioners and elucidate the underlying reasons. Furthermore, we will assess the Act’s potential industry impacts, highlighting both positive and negative side effects.

##### **Title: Trustworthy AI in Industrial Contexts: Balancing Innovation and Reliability**  

##### **Abstract**  
As artificial intelligence reshapes cyber-physical systems, the imperative for trustworthy AI has never been more critical. This talk explores the essential frameworks that enable responsible and effective AI deployment in industrial applications, with focus on technological robustness, ethical considerations, and operational reliability.  

The presentation will address three major dimensions of AI trustworthiness:  

- Strategic risk mitigation approaches that ensure predictability and safety in complex industrial settings  
- Ethical design principles emphasizing transparency and human-centric AI development

##### **Title: Formal verification and certified machine learning and Airbus**   

##### **Abstract**  
Machine learning applications have been gaining considerable attention in the field of transportation. However, their use in real-life operational safety-critical products, in particular in the aeronautical domain subject to stringent certification, raises several issues regarding functional correctness, compliance with requirements, formal verification, safety or implementation. In this talk, we will briefly present the current guidelines for integrating ML algorithms in airborne systems, with a focus on the verifiability aspect. We will then see some promising formal verification results on surrogate models and on object detection models.

##### **Title: Assume-Guarantee Contracts for Trustworthy Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems**

##### **Abstract**  
Abstract: Increasingly more sophisticated tasks that were previously allocated to humans are expected to be performed by software, including modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods, in a variety of mission-critical cyber-physical systems, for example, in avionics, automobiles, robotics, and manufacturing. One of the biggest challenges to trustworthy autonomy is arguably in showing that these software and AI-enabled autonomous functions, running on heterogeneous, interconnected sensing, computation, and actuation platforms, will still satisfy the stringent safety and dependability requirements of mission-critical systems in uncertain or unpredictable environments.

In this talk, I will introduce our approach to design-time assurance for autonomous cyber-physical systems, leveraging the rich modeling and specification formalism of assume-guarantee contracts and their probabilistic extensions. I will present how contracts enable compositional, quantitative requirement analysis and system verification in the presence of uncertainty as well as correct-by-construction, logically constrained decision making and learning under uncertainty. I will then discuss how contracts can provide the semantic foundation for the automated construction of assurance cases, structured arguments about system dependability, which can accelerate system certification and help transition from a process-driven to a property-driven and evidence-based certification approach. Finally, I’ll conclude with a vision, mediated by contracts, for continuous assurance of intelligent autonomous systems.
