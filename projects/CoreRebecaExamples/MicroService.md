#### Problem Description
We illustrate modeling of micro-service architecture using an online retail system. This system is a platform that facilitates the buying and selling of goods and services over the Internet. This system typically consists of various components, including a user-friendly interface for customers, a shopping cart, payment gateways, and back-end processes for managing orders, inventory, and shipping. Customers can browse products, add items to their cart, and complete transactions securely from the comfort of their homes. For retailers, it provides tools to manage product listings, track inventory, handle customer inquiries, and analyze sales data.

The core behavior of an online customer in a retail system is browsing, which may sometimes lead to placing an order. A placed order is checked for item availability. If the items are available, they are shipped to the customer.

#### Properties

**Safety:** We want to check there is no racing in the model and the number of remained items in not below zero.
